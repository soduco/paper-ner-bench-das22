\section{Dataset}

TODO interesting points to detail:
\begin{itemize}
    \item origin
    \item illustration (maybe in first figure)
    \item various numbers (of original data and of the sample we extracted)
    \item statistics about entry lengths (histogram of number of char / tokens par entry)
    \item entities we considered and how we annotated them (how we assessed gold's quality)
    \item OCR data (automated systems and clean text + how we created the "clean" text + whether/how we assessed clean text's quality)
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
