\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NER quality: accuracy? precision? recall? f-score? (idea: stick with standard spacy/sklearn metrics)
    \item OCR accuracy: outputs from standard tools (beware of unknown glyphs: do we need any special care?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training procedure}
train/val/test splits, number of runs, etc.


\subsection{Parameters for each method}


\subsection{Implementation details}
we use spacy \mcite{spacy}
will we use FLAIR as well?
