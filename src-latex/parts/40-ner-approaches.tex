\begin{itemize}
    \item regexp
    \item spacy cnn
    \item spacy cnn + lexicon (warning: how do we build it?)
    \item transformer
\end{itemize}


% Other possibilities:
1. Traditional ML based:

    Conditional Random Fields (CRF) - https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-crfsuite/
    Maximum-entropy Markov model

2. Neural Networks based:

    LSTMs, bi-LSTM - https://github.com/flairNLP/flair
    CNNs (SpaCy uses CNN based architecture)
    Transformers (Spacy has recently launched it) - https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-transformers
