\section{NER Approaches}

\begin{itemize}
    \item regexp
    \item Spacy CNN with tok2vec
    \item CamemBERT finetuned with wikiner-fr + gold dataset (clean texts)
    \item CamemBERT finetuned with wikiner-fr + gold dataset (clean texts + pretrained on raw texts (Pero ? Kraken ? Both ?)
\end{itemize}


% Other possibilities:
1. Traditional ML based:
    Conditional Random Fields (CRF) - https://pypi.org/project/sklearn-crfsuite/
    Maximum-entropy Markov model

2. Neural Networks based:
    LSTMs, bi-LSTM - https://github.com/flairNLP/flair
    CNNs (SpaCy uses CNN based architecture)
    Transformers (Spacy has recently launched it) - https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-transformers
