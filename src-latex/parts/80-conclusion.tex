\section{Conclusion}

Ideas for future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate this: fine-tune Spacy NER on a few samples to generated a bootstrap dataset, feed it to BERT (cleaned or raw) to create an good model with minimal efforts ?
    \item Use ML to infer regexes ?
    \item As directories entries are always structured the same way (in a given list at least): use NER to identify entries within pages to save the burden of having to rely on the page layout ?
\end{itemize}
