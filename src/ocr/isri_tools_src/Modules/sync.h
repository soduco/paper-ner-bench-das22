 *
 *  This module provides support for string synchronization.  There are
 *  two algorithms based on the detection of long common substrings:
 *  "synchronize" can match two or more text streams but does not find
 *  transposed matches, while "transpose_sync" locates transposed
 *  matches but can be applied to only two text streams.  A third
 *  algorithm, "fastukk_sync", is based on an algorithm by Ukkonen, and
 *  finds an optimal match of two text streams using cost function
 *  (1,1,1).
