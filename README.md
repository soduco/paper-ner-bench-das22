# paper-ner-bench-das22
Sources (latex and code?) for our DAS 2022 paper (NER benchmark)

## Writing the paper
Official instructions for authors: <https://das2022.univ-lr.fr/index.php/author-instructions/>

Key info:
- Springer LNCS format
  - template documentation available as [llncsdoc.pdf](llncsdoc.pdf)
- Up to 15 pages
- Deadline: 4 Jan. 2022 (expect 1 week extension)

Structure:
- latex sources are in `src-latex`
- main latex file for the paper is `src-latex/main-paper.tex`
- sub-parts are under `src-latex/parts/` to limit edition conflicts ← edit `.tex` files here


## Code
Code could be either under another subdirectory or in another repo…


## Dataset
Depending on the size of the dataset, we will either share it with GitHub, or with Zenodo.

## Official assets
Maybe the current repo should remain public, and we copy/paste the relevant content on a public repo upon publication.
Or we just set it public after.
No strong opinion here yet.
